`get_api_index()` returns `status`, `kind: api_index`, `version`, `endpoint_count`, bound listener prefixes, and the advertised HTTP routes.

`get_game_state()` and `mp_get_game_state()` JSON responses include `status: ok`, `kind` (`singleplayer_state` or `multiplayer_state`), `state_type`, and the active-run context fields when a run is in progress.

Profile, profile-list, and Compendium tools include `status`, `kind`, `profile_id`, `progress_path`, `resolved_progress_path`, `profile_root`, and `save_scope`; profile and Compendium responses also include `current_run` when a run is active, so callers can distinguish the active profile, save scope, local save location, and current run attempt.

Save/path context fields are normalized with forward slashes, including Windows absolute paths.

Profile switch/delete failures are surfaced as structured endpoint errors with HTTP 400 for invalid input and HTTP 409 for state conflicts such as deleting the active profile or switching during a run.

POST validation failures preserve endpoint `error_code` values such as `invalid_json`, `missing_action`, `invalid_action_type`, `missing_profile_id`, `invalid_profile_id_type`, and `invalid_action_payload`.

Route-level failures preserve endpoint `error_code` values such as `method_not_allowed`, `not_found`, and `internal_error`.

Read endpoint startup/data-availability failures preserve endpoint `error_code` values such as `save_manager_unavailable`, `settings_data_unavailable`, and `profile_data_unavailable`.

Read endpoint exceptions preserve endpoint-specific `error_code` values such as `settings_read_failed`, `bestiary_build_failed`, `glossary_build_failed`, `profile_build_failed`, `profiles_read_failed`, `compendium_build_failed`, `singleplayer_state_read_failed`, and `multiplayer_state_read_failed`.

Menu/action dispatch failures also use structured endpoint errors: missing or unknown main-menu selections and unknown actions return HTTP 400, gameplay actions sent without an active run return HTTP 409, Timeline manual-reveal blocks return HTTP 409 with `error_code: timeline_manual_action_required`, and blocking tutorial/popup overlays return HTTP 409 with `error_code: blocking_popup_active`. Older generic action failures carry the stable fallback `error_code: action_error` instead of omitting an error code. Other failed actions return non-2xx structured error JSON instead of HTTP 200. MCP wrappers preserve those structured JSON error bodies and add `http_status` so callers can handle endpoint failures without parsing a flat text prefix.

Glossary tools require an active run. They include the current character context plus shared run pools such as Colorless cards, shared relics, and shared potions. Card glossary items include energy/star costs, upgrade availability, plus upgraded-preview cost and description. Successful responses include `profile_id`, `progress_path`, `resolved_progress_path`, `profile_root`, `save_scope`, `current_run.run_id`, `current_run.seed`, `kind`, `count`, and `items`. The HTTP endpoints return `run_not_in_progress` with HTTP 409 when called from the main menu, or `run_state_unavailable` with HTTP 503 if the active run state cannot be read, while still including the active profile/save context fields.

## Multiplayer

All multiplayer tools are prefixed with `mp_`. They route through `/api/v1/multiplayer` and are only available during multiplayer (co-op) runs. The endpoints automatically guard against cross-mode calls.
